# hyprkarl
Work in progress configuration files for CachyOS + hyprland

## Setup

### Requirements
- Base CachyOS (hyprland) install

### Installation
- Clone into `~/.local/share/hyprkarl`
- Set up packages with `setup.sh`
- Use uwsm configs to enable the hyprkarl commands (essential for operation of most configs)
- For now, move configs manually into their places in `~/.config`
- The hyprkarl config directory just has theming files at the moment; I think only really the waybar config is 100% necessary for defining colors referenced in the primary configs.
- I plan to make a script for moving the files automatically once I have the configs settled.
